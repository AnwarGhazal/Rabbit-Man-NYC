<h1>Where can you spot the Rabbit Man?</h1>
<p>Rabbit Man is a New Yorker, and can be spotted all over Manhattan. Rabbit Man<br> 
   is known to hang out where you find good street food, like 116 st, and Park<bt> 
   buying<br> a tamale from a mexican woman, or China town eating steam buns walking<br>
   down canal street. He is also known to hangout on NYC roof tops, where the cities<br>
   loud noises and sirens are softer on his super sonic hearing. His best friends are<br> 
   Spider Man and Dare Devil, who are also roof top dwellers.</p>
