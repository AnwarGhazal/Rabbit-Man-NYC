                    <h1>The Amazing Rabbit Man</h1>
         <p>Along with moving fast and camouflague, Rabbit Man's main super power<br>
            is the ability to hear someone in dager from miles away. He's actually the<br>
            super hero that does all the grunt work for Spider Man and Dare Devil.<br>
            He saves the city because it's his city where he is respected and loved.</p>
